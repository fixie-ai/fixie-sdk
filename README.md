# Fixie SDK

This is the official Python SDK for Fixie.

## What is Fixie?

Fixie is a platform for building applications using large language models. In Fixie, an application
consists of a set of natural-language **queries** that are handled by one or more **agents**.
Each agent consists of a large language model coupled with some custom code to process or generate
data, or call out to external systems, such as databases or APIs. By composing agents together,
you can create complex workflows with very little code.

## Installation

The easiest way to install the Fixie SDK is via `pip`:

```
pip install fixieai
```

## Build Agents

Agents are at the heart of the Fixie ecosystem, and we make it easy to build and contribute your own. To get started, check out our [examples repo](https://github.com/fixie-ai/fixie-examples) or [read the docs](https://docs.fixie.ai/agents/).

## Using the Fixie CLI

In order to get started making requests to Fixie, you'll need an API key. You can get your Fixie API key on your profile page at https://app.fixie.ai.
Set the value of the `FIXIE_API_KEY` environment variable to your API key:

```
$ export FIXIE_API_KEY=" -- your API key here -- "
```

The Fixie CLI tool lets you use Fixie interactively from the command line.

Run `fixie --help` to see a list of available commands.

```
$ fixie console
Welcome to Fixie!

   @{'handle': 'user'}: Hello there
   @{'handle': 'user'}: Hello there
   @{'handle': 'fixie'}: Hello there
   @{'handle': 'fixie'}: Thought: This is not a question. I need to greet the user.
   @{'handle': 'fixie'}: Hi there! How can I help you?
1‚ùØ Hi there! How can I help you?

```

## Integrate with our Client API

The simplest way to use Fixie from your app is to use the `fixie.query` method
to send a query:

```
import fixieai
response = fixieai.query("Hello there!")
print(response)
```

For more control, you can also create a `FixieClient` object and use it to
create a `Session` and send queries within the `Session`:

```
import fixieai
client = fixieai.FixieClient()
session = client.create_session()
response = session.query("What is 38 * 20302?")
print(response)
```
