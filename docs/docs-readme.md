To add a new theme run the following commands:

```
poetry add theme-name
just install
just serve-docs

```

Make sure the new theme name is used in [mkdocs.yml](https://github.com/fixie-ai/fixie-sdk/blob/main/mkdocs.yml) file under theme/name. You should be able to checkout the docs on local page at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
