# Fixie Agent Quickstart

Fixie allows you to extend the capabilities of the Fixie Platform by building your own
**Agents**, which are specialized software components that combine a set of **few-shot examples**
with **code** to invoke external systems. We call this combination of few-shots coupled with code 
**Code Shots** (clever, eh?).

You can implement Fixie Agents in any programming language, however, the Fixie SDK currently
provides bindings only for Python. See the [Agent Protocol](agent-protocol.md) for details
on implementing your own Agent in a language other than Python. We'll be shipping bindings for
other languages soon!

## Example Agent code

Here is the complete code for an Agent, which you get from `examples/agents/randint.py` in the
Fixie SDK tree.

```python
import random
import fixieai

BASE_PROMPT = "I am a simple agent that generates a random number between two given values."
FEW_SHOTS = """
Q: Generate a random number between 0 and 19.
Ask Func[genrand]: 0, 19
Func[genrand] says: 17
A: The random number is 17.

Q: Generate a random value from 5 to 10, inclusive.
Ask Func[genrand]: 5, 10
Func[genrand] says: 8
A: The random number is 8.
"""

agent = fixieai.CodeShotAgent(BASE_PROMPT, FEW_SHOTS)

@agent.register_func()
def genrand(query: fixieai.Message) -> str:
    high, low = query.text.replace(" ", "").split(",")
    return str(random.randint(int(low), int(high)))

agent.serve("random")
```

The code consists of two main parts:

* **`BASE_PROMPT`** and **`FEW_SHOTS`**: These are the few-shot examples that define the Agent's
  purpose and behavior. The few-shots are used to providing examples to the underlying
  Large Language Model, such as GPT-3, as well as to provide the Fixie Platform information
  on what kinds of queries this Agent can support.
* **Code snippets**: These are the functions that are invoked by the Code Shots. The
  code snippets are registered with the agent using the `register_func` decorator.

In the `FEW_SHOTS` string, the `Func[genrand]` keyword indicates that the function
`genrand` should be invoked when the output of the underlying LLM starts with this string.
The values following `Ask Func[genrand]:` are passed to the function as the `query.text`
parameter. In this case, the function parses out the values and returns a random number
between those two values.

## Test the Agent locally

To test an Agent locally, run it on your machine, and send it an HTTP GET request on
the port 8181. This will return the list of few-shot examples supported by the Agent,
demonstrating that the Agent is responding to queries on the correct port.

For example, to test the above agent, run the following command:

```bash
$ pip install fixieai
$ python examples/agents/random.py

# In another terminal...
$ curl http://localhost:8181 | python -m json.tool
```

You should see something like:
```
{
    "base_prompt": "I am a simple agent that generates a random number between two given values.",
    "few_shots": [
        "Q: Generate a random number between 0 and 19.\nAsk Func[genrand]: 0, 19\nFunc[genrand] says: 17\nA: The random number is 17.",
        "Q: Generate a random value from 5 to 10, inclusive.\nAsk Func[genrand]: 5, 10\nFunc[genrand] says: 8\nA: The random number is 8."
    ]
}
```

The Agent code itself will respond to a POST request sent to the URL `http://localhost:8181/genrand`
with a JSON payload containing the parameters to the `genrand` function. For example:

```bash
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"message": {"text": "1, 100"}}' \
  http://localhost:8181/genrand
```

You should get back the result:
```json
{"message":{"text":"66","embeds":{}}}
```

The format of the JSON messages accepted by and returned by Fixie Agents is described in
the [Agent Protocol](agent-protocol.md) document.

## Deploy your Agent

You can deploy your Agent on any web server that supports Python. We recommend using [Replit](https://replit.com) as an easy-to-use
starting point.

All you need to do is create a new Python Replit project, and copy
the code for your Agent into the `main.py` file. You can then run the Agent by clicking the "Run" button in the Replit UI. Your Agent should
have a URL that you can use to test it. For example, if you named your Replit project `myrandagent`, you can test your Agent by running:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   --data '{"message": {"text": "1, 100"}}' \
   https://myrandagent.repl.co:8181/genrand
```

## Integrate your Agent into Fixie

Now you're ready to create your Agent in the Fixie Platform.
Visit [https://app.fixie.ai/agents](https://app.fixie.ai/agents) and click on the "Add Agent" button. You'll be prompted to enter the URL
of your Agent, which in the Replit example above would be

```
https://myrandagent.repl.co:8181
```

The **Agent Handle** field should contain the same string used
in your Agent's `agent.serve()` call. In the example above, the Agent Handle is `randint`, however, since this handle might already
be taken by another Agent, you will need to change the Agent handle
in the `agent.serve()` call to something unique. (Once you've claimed
a handle, you can use it for future iterations of your Agent
code; it is not necessary to change the Agent handle every time you
update your Agent code.) 

Once you've added the Agent, you can test it out by entering
a Fixie Session and issuing a query such as:

```
@randint Generate a random number between 1 and 100.
```

Congrats! You've just created your first Fixie Agent!

See [Agent Protocol](agent-protocol.md) for details on how to implement an Agent directly
in a language other than Python, as well as [Agent API](agents.md) for details on the
complete Fixie Agent API.
